## My insights

- Fleek provides an easy way to deploy static sites. 
- Fleek is free. So it is a very attractive service.
- Not sure that Fleek is suitable for Russian business due to Russian laws on personal data. 
- Interesting to know is it possible to deploy .net backend and frontend applications.
