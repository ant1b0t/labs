## Definition and purpose

Version control systems (VCS) are software tools that track changes in files for collaborative software development. They help manage code history, enable teamwork, and allow for easy code sharing and merging.

## Benefits and advantages

- Change tracking. Detailed history of modifications.
- Collaboration and teamwork. Parallel development and easy merging.
- Code revert and recovery. Roll back to previous versions.
- Branching and parallel development. Independent work on different features.

## Types of Version Control Systems

- **Centralized VCS (CVCS)**: One central server, e.g., SVN, Perforce.
- **Distributed VCS (DVCS)**: Local copies, offline work, e.g., Git, Mercurial.

## Comparison of Popular VCS

- **Git**: Fast, flexible, powerful branching and merging.
- **Subversion (SVN)**: Centralized, strong atomic commits and access control.
- **Mercurial**: Similar to Git, but with a simpler interface.

## Conclusion
VCS is crucial for collaborative development, offering change tracking, teamwork facilitation, code recovery, and efficient code management.
