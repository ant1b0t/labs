## Docker

1. I have installed docker already. 

'Server: Docker Desktop 4.18.0 (104112)
 Engine:
  Version:          20.10.24'

2. I have installed docker compose already.

'Docker Compose version v2.17.2'

I just download the installation file from the docker official site and install the software by GUI.
