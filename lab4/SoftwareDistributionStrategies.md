## Definition

Software distribution refers to the process of delivering software applications to end-users or customers. 
It involves packaging the software, along with any necessary installation files and documentation, and making it available for download, physical distribution, or deployment on various platforms.

## Software distribution strategies

1. Direct Download (downloading installation files or launch app files).
2. App Stores (Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and Microsoft Store).
3. Package Managers. APT (Advanced Package Tool) for Debian-based distributions and Homebrew for macOS.
4. Software as a Service (SaaS). Software is distributed over the internet, and users access it through web browsers or dedicated client applications

## Best practices

* Secure Distribution. Ensure the software is distributed securely by using encryption, digital signatures, and secure channels for download or updates.
* User Feedback and Support. Establish channels for users to provide feedback, report bugs, and seek support.
* Compatibility Testing. Test the software on different platforms, operating systems, and configurations to ensure compatibility and a smooth installation experience.
* Automation and Updates. Automate software updates to deliver bug fixes, security patches, and new features to users efficiently. 
* Scalability. Consider scalability when choosing a software distribution strategy.
* User Experience. Focus on providing a seamless and user-friendly experience during the installation and setup process, minimizing complexities and technical hurdles.
